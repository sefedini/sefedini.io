        <p>The dance is traditionally danced in the Highlands of Gjakova.

            The folk dances of the Highlands of Gjakova stand out for their special rhythm and expressiveness.<br> The distinguishing feature of men's folk dances is strength and dynamism, although they are characterized by spontaneity in interpretation, they also have a specific theme.<br> While the women's dances are very dynamic, elegant, sometimes explosive, but also laid out with pride and grace. Imagine the flight of Albanians to Sokol, there starts the rhythm of the mountain dance of the Gjakova Highlands.</p>
